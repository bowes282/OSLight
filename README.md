# OSLight
A bare-bones client for OSRS. Written in Java, so it works for all major platforms (Windows, Mac OSX, Linux)

#Download/Installation
Simply run the included OSLight.jar Java client. All Java compatible platforms are supported.

# Why use OSLight over other clients?
Simple. OSLight was created for one purpose: reduce the memory load of running an OSRS client. 

OSLight uses about half the RAM of other major OSRS clients. On my Macbook Pro, it runs at about 170MB of RAM while other
clients typically consumed 300-400MB. Try it out and see the difference in speed/responsiveness.
